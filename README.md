hey there all! this is the new repo readme

- The purpose of this repo is to create and implement a variety of game theoretic
models that can be run right on the ruby command line (and by extension on any
mac computer). These programs will work by running the simulations and then printing
the resulting board (or perhaps a bar graph?) to the console using ruby's extra powerfull
print methods. Possible games to include: schelling segregation model (already implemented
elsewhere), the hawk-dove game, evolution of egalitarianism game, the axelrod tournament(that would be quite a lot of work to be honest), can research others as I come to them and then I can add them later.
